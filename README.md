 Movie Watchlist App is a simple yet helpful tool for movie enthusiasts who want to search and keep track of their favorite films. Since I love watching movies so much, I thought I could combine the best of both worlds. The project was built using React, JavaScript, MaterialUI, and it uses OMDB API to provide real-time movie data.
