 Movie List App is a simple yet helpful tool for movie enthusiasts who want to keep track of their favorite films. Since I love watching movies so much, I thought I could combine the best of both worlds. The project was built using React, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, and uses TMDB API to provide real-time movie data.
